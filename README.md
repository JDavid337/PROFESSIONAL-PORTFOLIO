# PROFESSIONAL-PORTFOLIO
My professional portfolio featuring my pages, bio &amp; contact info

This is my portfolio page, updated as of 04-11-21. It is designed to showcase web pages that I have designed and created, utilizing my skills honed at the DU bootcamp.  It also provides a short biography about me, along with two recent photos of me, one indoor and one outdoor. At the footer of my web page is my contact information, designed as links so employers can easily get in contact with me, view my work in GitHub, see my updated profile in LinkedIn, and view a most recent copy of my resume.

Beneath my initial photograph are three buttons designed to take the user to that section of the page that the buttons corralate with.  This is to provide seemless navigation throughout the page.  

Below my bio are two homework assignments that I take pride in showcasing, as well as Project 1, my first coding collaboration.  Buttons provided beneath each preview of the page will take you to the live deployed page of that web app. 

The live web page is available to view here:
